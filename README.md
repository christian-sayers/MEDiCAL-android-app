# MEDiCAL: Smart Pill Dispenser System

A smart, WiFi-connected pill dispenser system designed to reduce medication non-adherence among individuals with chronic illnesses through automation, accessibility, and mobile-first usability.

## 📌 Background

Medication non-adherence is a major public health challenge:

- **50%** of patients with chronic illnesses do not take their medications as prescribed.
- **69%** of medication-related hospitalizations result from non-adherence.
- **125,000 deaths** in the U.S. each year are linked to non-adherence.
- **Up to $300 billion** in preventable healthcare expenditures are attributed to this issue.

**MEDiCAL** was developed to address this gap with a user-friendly and affordable pill dispensing solution.
